            <h2><strong>Game Design</strong></h2>
            <p>
              I primarily utilize Unity, Unreal Engine, and Blender to make
              games, in addition to having created curriculum to teach these
              programs to students. With experience in modeling, scripting,
              audio production and asset creation, I have experience with all
              aspects of game production. As a generalist, I have worked as a
              manager, modeler, and designer on the various indie projects and
              jobs described below. My different skillsets have allowed me to
              design more efficiently and communicate on teams of all different
              skillsets. I care about designing effective solutions toward all
              levels of the production pipeline.

          <p>
            As an instructor for Game-U i facilitate the education of students
            from ages 6-18 in Game Design, 2d/3d Art, Animation, and Computer
            Science. I instruct students through curriculum for Unity,
            Construct, Godot, Blender, and independent coding projects within
            Replit. In addition, I create the curriculum for these classes,
            designing material for students with quantifiable goals within
            lesson modules.<br /><br />
            Being an educator not only in Game-U but also to teach Computer
            Science at <a href="computerscience.html"> Picatinny Arsenal</a>, I

          <h2><strong>Iguanamoth</strong> 2022-2023</h2>
          <p>
            A high paced motion driven game featuring the protaginist atop a
            hoverbaord within an everchanging environment.
          </p>
          <p>
            Iguanamoth was my capstone project at NJIT in which I was able to
            manage a team of fellow student developers for three months during
            the course. In addition to detailing all of the financial
            information of a potential business, I ensured the different members
            of the team completed their tasks. To complete the project within
            the deadline I assigned everyone to features through a Scrum Board.
            I handled weekly reports about progress, in as well as some of the
            modeling in game.

          <h2><strong>Aethersphere</strong> 2022</h2>
          <p>Roll and weave through difficult obstacles and balancing acts.</p>
          <p>
            A project for NJIT's 2022 Game Jam. Aethersphere was an action
            puzzle game featuring the player balancing a ball across difficult
            terrain. We quickly built out a series of levels and a sandbox for
            players to explore in. I designed a large section of the art assets
            within the game, in addition to the level design.
