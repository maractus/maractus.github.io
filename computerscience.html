            My Computer Science skills have allowed me to build websites,
            applications, and software for businesses and the Federal
            Government. My programming career has allowed me to teach students
            and peers, in addition to working on professional development teams.
            Through the use of Touchdesigner, I have also leveraged my skills to
            include GLSL to create realtime shaders and visuals for my digital
            production.

          <p>
            As an instructor for Game-U i facilitate the education of students
            from ages 6-18 in Game Design, 2d/3d Art, Animation, and Computer
            Science. I instruct students through curriculum for Unity,
            Construct, Godot, Blender, and independent coding projects within
            Replit. In addition, I create the curriculum for these classes,
            designing material for students with quantifiable goals within
            lesson modules.<br /><br />
            Being an educator not only in Game-U but also to teach Computer
            Science at <a href="computerscience.html"> Picatinny Arsenal</a>, I
            have years of experience designing strategies to ensure knowledge
            retention and proficiency.

          <h2><strong>Picatinny Arsenal</strong> 2017-2022</h2>
          <p>
            Picatinny Arsenal has allowed me to work on multiple development
            teams that provide software for the warfighter and groups that
            support them. Under seperate apperentice ships I worked under the
            Common Remotely Operated Weapon Station(CROWS) and the Gaming
            Interactive Technologies and Multimedia(GITM) teams. There, I
            developed the Commonly Remote Operated Weapon Station on a Scrum
            development team that tested and improved features in C++ and C to
            update previous iterations. While part of GITM, I built project
            management plugins for the management program, Redmine, employing
            Ruby on Rails to implement new features. <br /><br />
            This apprenticeship also allowed me to work as an educator. I was
            able to teach classes and provide curriculum for students in the
            6-8th grade, in addition to working as beta tester on a modular
            video game for students to virtually build their own robots.
