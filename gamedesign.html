          <h2>About Me</h2>
          <p>I primarily utilize Unity and Godot to make games. As a generalist, I have worked as a manager, modeler, and designer on the various indie projects I've worked on. Leveraging my different skills has allowed me to design more efficiently and communicate on teams of all different skillsets. </p>

          <h5>Manager</h5>
          
          <p>A high paced motion driven game featuring the protaginist atop a hoverbaord within an everchanging environment.</p>
          <p>
            Iguanamo th was my capstone project at NJIT in which I was able to manage a team of fellow student developers for three months during the course. In addition to detailing all of the financial information of a potential business, I ensured the different members of the team completed their tasks.  To complete the project within the deadline I assigned everyone to features through a Scrum Board. I handled weekly reports about progress, in as well as some of the modeling in game.

        <h2>Aethersphere</h2>
        <h5>Artist and Designer</h5>
        <p>Roll and weave through difficult obstacles and balancing acts. </p>
        <p>A project for NJIT's 2022 Game Jam. Aethersphere was an action puzzle game featuring the player balancing a ball across difficult terrain. We quickly built out a series of levels and a sandbox for players to explore in. I designed a large section of the art assets within the game, in addition to the level design.</p>
