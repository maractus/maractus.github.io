          <h2>About Me</h2>
          <p>My Computer Science skills have allowed me to build websites, applications, and software for businesses and the Federal Government. My programming career has allowed me to teach students and peers,
             in addition to working on professional development teams. Through the use of Touchdesigner, I have also leveraged my skills to include GLSL to create realtime shaders and visuals for my digital production.  </p>

          <h2>Picatinny Arsenal</h2>
          <h5>AEOP Apprentice</h5>
          
          <p> Picatinny Arsenal has allowed me to work on multiple development teams that provide software for the warfighter and groups that support them. Under seperate apperentice ships I worked 
            under the Common Remotely Operated Weapon Station(CROWS) and the Gaming Interactive Technologies and Multimedia(GITM) teams. There, I developed the Commonly Remote Operated Weapon Station on a Scrum development team that tested and improved features in C++ and C to update previous iterations. 
            While part of GITM, I built project management plugins for the management program, Redmine, employing Ruby on Rails to implement new features.  <br><br> This apprenticeship also allowed me to work as an educator.
            I was able to teach classes and provide curriculum for students in the 6-8th grade, in addition to working as beta tester on a modular video game for students to virtually build their own robots.
